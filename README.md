Computational Methods 2

In senior year, I was selected to take a graduate course titled Computation Methods 2. This course was an expansion upon Computational Methods 1, and focused on solving differential equations with MATLAB for the 1st half of the course. 

The 2nd half of the course focused on OpenFOAM and CFD solving techniques. The codes for week6-10 can be found in cfdhbd github under 'openFoam'
