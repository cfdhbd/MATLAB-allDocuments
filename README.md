Computational Methods 2

In senior year, I was selected to take a graduate course titled Computation Methods 2. This course was an expansion upon Computational Methods 1, and focused on solving differential equations with MATLAB for the 1st half of the course. 

The final project for this half of the course was of our choosing. I chose to develop a neural network to learn and predit steam entahlpy, entropy, specific volume and internal energy given temperature and pressure. I downloaded the necessary textbooks, learned the DE's, and applied them within MATLAB. The work for this project can be found under the NeuralSteam Folder. 

The 2nd half of the course focused on OpenFOAM and CFD solving techniques. The codes for week6-10 can be found in cfdhbd github under 'openFoam'

In addition to the Computational Methods course, there are files for my Capstone project (martian soil filtration models...enzyme reactions) and various PDE's for my Unit Operations class.
